# Predicting-acupuncture-efficacy-for-FD
This MATLAB code is applied to establish SVC prediction models for the prediction of acupuncture responders and non-responders, as well as the  symptoms relief. 
In the file named SVC_prediciton_code.mat, we performed three parts of work: 1) the optimal feature selection threshold determination, SVC model establishment and predicting features identification. While in the  file named SVR_prediciton_code.mat, we established the prediction models based on the identified predicting features to forecast the improvement of the Symptom Index of Dyspepsia score after treatment. These prediction models were developed based on the Support Vector Machine Algorithm. See details about SVM in the folder named matlab_libsvm or https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/Libsvm.
